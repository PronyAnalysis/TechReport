In fact, here you can see the inverse Prony map. Each surface corresponds to a sphere in the four-dimensional moment space with given radius ($r=\{1.5, 3.5, 5.5, 7.5\}$ for red, green, blue, and purple surfaces respectively) and center ($(1, 1, \mu_U)$). This means that if $S_U$ and $S_V$ belong to inner region of a surface of radius $r$, the corresponded distance in the moment space will less that $2r$.
