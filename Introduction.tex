\section{Introduction}
Consider a signals composition
$$
\{ (a_j, x_j) \}
$$

where a_j are signals amplitudes and x_j are signals positions. Define the Prony map as a map $\{ (a_j, x_j) \} \mapsto (\{m_k\})$ of the following form:
$$
m_k = \sum_{j=1}^N a_j x_j^k.
$$
  
$\{m_k\}$ are moments of the signal compositions.
